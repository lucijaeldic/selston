			<h2>Granite or marble</h2>
			<p class="description">Granite or marble: what to choose for kitchen worktops, stairs, or countertops?</p>
			<p>This is one of the most difficult decisions when looking for interior decoration. Whether you are equipping, or remodeling a house, hotel, or cafe, you will be faced with this dilemma.</p>
			<p>These are good quality and aesthetically pleasing materials, none of which is better, it's hard to say. We bring you the advantages and disadvantages because it is just as important for you to make your own decision.</p>
            <p>Impregnation is a simple process that prevents stains and preserves the beauty of stone. We recommend impregnating agents that penetrate the surface of the stone and protect it from moisture, dirt and stains. Prior to impregnation, thoroughly clean the stone to prevent existing grease and impurities from entering the material structure.</p>
			<p>Marble is a metamorphic rock formed from limestone that has been exposed to extreme heat and pressures caused by the tectonic movement of the earth's crust.</p>
            <p>Granite is a magnetic rock composed of quartz, orthoclass, potassium and limestone particles.</p>
